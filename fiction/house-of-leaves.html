                <div class="book-description">
                    Years ago, when House of Leaves was first being passed around, it was nothing more than a badly
                    bundled heap of paper, parts of which would occasionally surface on the Internet. No one could have
                    anticipated the small but devoted following this terrifying story would soon command. Starting with
                    an odd assortment of marginalized youth—musicians, tattoo artists, programmers, strippers,
                    environmentalists, and adrenaline junkies—the book eventually made its way into the hands of older
                    generations, who not only found themselves in those strangely arranged pages but also discovered a
                    way back into the lives of their estranged children.
                    <br><br>
                    Now made available in book form, complete with the original colored words, vertical footnotes, and
                    second and third appendices, the story remains unchanged. Similarly, the cultural fascination with
                    House of Leaves remains as fervent and as imaginative as ever. The novel has gone on to inspire
                    doctorate-level courses and masters theses, cultural phenomena like the online urban legend of “the
                    backrooms,” and incredible works of art in entirely unrealted mediums from music to video games.
                    <br><br>
                    Neither Pulitzer Prize-winning photojournalist Will Navidson nor his companion Karen Green was
                    prepared to face the consequences of the impossibility of their new home, until the day their two
                    little children wandered off and their voices eerily began to return another story—of creature
                    darkness, of an ever-growing abyss behind a closet door, and of that unholy growl which soon enough
                    would tear through their walls and consume all their dreams.
