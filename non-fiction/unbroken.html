                <div class="book-description">
                    On a May afternoon in 1943, an Army Air Forces bomber crashed into the Pacific Ocean and
                    disappeared, leaving only a spray of debris and a slick of oil, gasoline, and blood. Then, on the
                    ocean surface, a face appeared. It was that of a young lieutenant, the plane’s bombardier, who was
                    struggling to a life raft and pulling himself aboard. So began one of the most extraordinary
                    odysseys of the Second World War.
                    <br><br>
                    The lieutenant’s name was Louis Zamperini. In boyhood, he’d been a cunning and incorrigible
                    delinquent, breaking into houses, brawling, and fleeing his home to ride the rails. As a teenager,
                    he had channeled his defiance into running, discovering a prodigious talent that had carried him to
                    the Berlin Olympics and within sight of the four-minute mile. But when war had come, the athlete had
                    become an airman, embarking on a journey that led to his doomed flight, a tiny raft, and a drift
                    into the unknown.
                    <br><br>
                    Ahead of Zamperini lay thousands of miles of open ocean, leaping sharks, a foundering raft, thirst
                    and starvation, enemy aircraft, and, beyond, a trial even greater. Driven to the limits of
                    endurance, Zamperini would answer desperation with ingenuity; suffering with hope, resolve, and
                    humor; brutality with rebellion. His fate, whether triumph or tragedy, would be suspended on the
                    fraying wire of his will.
                    <br><br>
                    In her long-awaited new book, Laura Hillenbrand writes with the same rich and vivid narrative voice
                    she displayed in Seabiscuit. Telling an unforgettable story of a man’s journey into extremity,
                    Unbroken is a testament to the resilience of the human mind, body, and spirit.
